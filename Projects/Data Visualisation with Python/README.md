## 📘 Overview

This folder focuses on **data visualization, exploratory analysis, interactive dashboards, and geospatial analytics**.

The projects demonstrate how visual tools can:

* Reveal hidden patterns
* Communicate insights effectively
* Support data-driven decision making

This work builds strong **visual storytelling skills**, which are essential before advancing to large-scale projects such as the **SpaceX Capstone**.
