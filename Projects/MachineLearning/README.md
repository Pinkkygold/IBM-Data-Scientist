# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  
## Coursework, Projects, and Capstone

This repository contains my complete work for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
It includes hands-on labs, datasets, notebooks, dashboards, machine learning models, and the final capstone project.

The repository is organized to reflect the learning journey of the program, progressing from
data analysis and visualization to machine learning, dashboards, and a full end-to-end capstone.
